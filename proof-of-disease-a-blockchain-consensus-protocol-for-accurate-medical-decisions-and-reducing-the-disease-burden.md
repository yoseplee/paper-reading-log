## criticisim
* 분산 환경에서 동일한 데이터에 대한 확인 작업과는 관계가 없다! 즉 의료 데이터 기반 서비스에 대한 내용이고 그럴 듯한 내용들이 파편화되어 있어서 내용 파악을 어렵게 한다. 현학적임
* 논문에서 사용한 단어인 Proof of disease는 자체 개발한 이더리움 기반의 시스템에서 데이터를 의미있게 취합하고 전문가들을 통해 proof하는 것을 의미한다.
* 결국 의료 서비스이고, 의료 데이터를 proof하기 위한 app인 것
    * The geneticist members of the PoDB will look at the genomics and biological background of the disease and ensure that it maps with the patient’s profile and previous encounters
* smart contract로 privacy control이 가능한가? -> 확인 필요
    * Smart Contracts to implement our privacy control as well (future work)

## pros
* Healthcare 분야에서 blockchain 사용의 필요성
* Healthcare 분야에서 blockchain 사용 예시: 이더리움 기반
* Healthcare 분야에서 발생하는 데이터의 종류들: summary의 EMR, EHR, HIE가 있다.
* Healthcare 분야의 데이터의 문제점: Unstructured natural language texts with medical jargons which a computer normally cannot understan

## cons
* [제발]논문 제목 이따구로 짓지 말것!!!!!

## summary
* health data must be computer understandable, secured, ubiquitous, and interoperable. Medical and disease data entered into computers are unstructured natural language texts with medical jargons which a computer normally cannot understand. EMR (Electronic Medical Records) are data silos in the hospital and do not interoperate.
* In this paper we present Ethereum based future ready Proof of Disease (PoD) consensus protocol with a computer understandable single instance of truth. It will solve many challenges that electronic health records (EHR) or health information exchange (HIE) have failed to address. This medical system will help achieve all the complex needs of P6 (Participatory, Personalized, Proactive, Preventive, Predictive and Precision) medicine and finally reduce the disease burden.
* To best of our knowledge, this is the **first time** a machine understandable blockchain based medical care system is constructed that uses a **Proof of Disease (PoD)** as a consensus protocol that combines evidence-based medicine and AI/KM (Artificial Intelligence/Knowledge Management).
